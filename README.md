# Office Fiddler

office-fiddler was an approach to bring JSFiddle into Office Web APP development.
It was available in the store for quite a while and was used but got deprecated quite a few years ago.
Just decided to put the code online

Most of the APIs etc used are heavily outdated and its not working anymore
